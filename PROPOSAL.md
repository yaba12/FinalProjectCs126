# Project Proposal

# Game Idea
For my final project, I would like to do something with the drawing and graphics. 

# Some Specifics
I am looking to do a drawing game such as tetris. As a kid I loved tetris while doing nothing and it would seem fun to attempt to recreate it. I could do so by loading images of the blocks and slowly dropping it by using [this refernce to loading images](http://openframeworks.cc/learning/02_graphics/how_to_load_and_display_an_image/). This covers the graphics part, but also, I can incorparate music into the game, [the tetris theme song.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sN8Cq5HEBug). It would require keeping track of scores and objects. I could also add some of my own implements such as pushing a button to increase or decrease speed. I would of course need to make a UI as well, using libraries such as [this](https://forum.openframeworks.cc/t/ofxui-a-user-interface-addon-for-of/8862). I believe this to be a good project because while it sounds not too difficult, it certainly forces me to learn different areas of openframeworks and to implement them into a single project which brings it together.
